\chapter*{\Large Acknowledgments}

I would like to thank Dr.\ Luca Cortese, Dr.\ O. Ivy Wong, and Dr.\ Barbara Catinella for their extraordinary support in my master's research.
When I started this research in Australia in August 2018, every single step was new and hard for me.
I did not know many things about basic galaxy properties, radio astronomy, and even how to make progress in the research.
However, every time I faced a problem, they spared so much time and gave me help and advice.
I am grateful for their kindness, and I think my research project can't reach the level without their help.
I also thank all of my friends I met in the International Centre for Radio Astronomy Research (ICRAR), Australia.
They were always kind to me and gave me much help when I had a problem to do research and to live in a foreign country.
During my stay there in a total of about five months, I discussed various fields of astrophysics and also the general topics with them.
This experience broadens my horizons and makes my two years master's course much more fruitful than I expected. \\
I also would like to thank Dr.\ Tsutomu T. Takeuchi, who is my supervisor at Nagoya University.
He gave me so many opportunities to go the outside university and to get extensive knowledge not only in astronomy.
He was thoughtful and gave me shrewd advice every time I got stuck on a problem.
His admired expertise in astrophysics, statistics, linguistics expands my perspectives.
I am grateful for everything he has done for me. \\
I would like to thank my colleagues and friends in Nagoya University and Osaka University also.
They always supported me when I was suffering from the research and my life. \\
I also appreciate my parents to raise me with so much money and time. \\
This project would have been impossible without funding from Nagoya University (Overseas Challenge Program for Young Researchers 2019).
