I would like to thank Prof. Tsutomu T. Takeuchi, Dr. Luca Cortese, Dr. O. Ivy Wong and Dr. Barbara Catinella for their extraordinary support in my master's research.
I would like to thank my colleagues also for their helpful and enjoyable discussion with me.
You always supported me when I was suffering the research and my life.
This project would have been impossible without the funding from Nagoya University (Overseas Challenge Program for Young Researchers 2019).
