abstract = {We present a mosaic image of the 1.4-GHz radio continuum emission from the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) observed with the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA) and the Parkes Telescope. The mosaic covers with an angular resolution of 40 arcsec, corresponding to a spatial scale of ∼10 pc in the LMC. The final image is suitable for studying emission on all scales between 40 arcsec and the surveyed area. In this paper, we discuss (i) the characteristics of the LMC's diffuse and compact radio continuum emission, (ii) the fraction of the emission produced by thermal processes and the implied star formation rate in the LMC and (iii) variations in the radio spectral index across the LMC. Two non-standard reduction techniques that we used to process the ATCA visibility data may be of interest for future wide-field radio continuum surveys. The data are open to the astronomical community and should be a rich resource for studies of individual objects such as supernova remnants, H ii regions and planetary nebulae as well as extended features such as the diffuse emission from synchrotron radiation. {\textcopyright} 2007 The Authors.},

abstract = {A key for understanding the evolution of galaxies and in particular their star formation history will be future ultradeep radio surveys. While star formation rates (SFRs) are regularly estimated with phenomenological formulas based on the local FIR-radio correlation, we present here a physically motivatedmodel to relate star formationwith radio fluxes. Such a relation holds only in frequency ranges where the flux is dominated by synchrotron emission, as this radiation originates from cosmic rays produced in supernova remnants, therefore reflecting recent star formation. At low frequencies, synchrotron emission can be absorbed by the free-free mechanism. This suppression becomes stronger with increasing number density of the gas, more precisely of the free electrons. We estimate the critical observing frequency below which radio emission is not tracing the SFR, and use the three well-studied local galaxies M51, M82, and Arp 220 as test cases for our model. If the observed galaxy is at high redshift, this critical frequency moves along with other spectral features to lower values in the observing frame. In the absence of systematic evolutionary effects, one would therefore expect that the method can be applied at lower observing frequencies for high-redshift observations. However, in case of a strong increase of the typical gas column densities towards high redshift, the increasing free-free absorption may erase the star formation signatures at low frequencies. At high radio frequencies both, free-free emission and the thermal bump, can dominate the spectrum, also limiting the applicability of this method.},

abstract = {We present a study of the low-frequency radio properties of star-forming (SF) galaxies and active galactic nuclei (AGNs) up to redshift z = 2.5. The new spectral window probed by the Low Frequency Array (LOFAR) allows us to reconstruct the radio continuum emission from 150 MHz to 1.4 GHz to an unprecedented depth for a radio-selected sample of 1542 galaxies in {\~{}}7deg2 of the LOFAR Bootes field. Using the extensive multiwavelength data set available in Bootes and detailed modelling of the far-infrared to ultraviolet spectral energy distribution (SED), we are able to separate the star formation (N = 758) and the AGN (N = 784) dominated populations. We study the shape of the radio SEDs and their evolution across cosmic time and find significant differences in the spectral curvature between the SF galaxy and AGN populations. While the radio spectra of SF galaxies exhibit a weak but statistically significant flattening, AGN SEDs show a clear trend to become steeper towards lower frequencies. No evolution of the spectral curvature as a function of redshift is found for SF galaxies or AGNs. We investigate the redshift evolution of the infrared-radio correlation for SF galaxies and find that the ratio of total infrared to 1.4-GHz radio luminosities decreases with increasing redshift: q1.4 GHz = (2.45 ± 0.04) (1 + z)-0.15 ± 0.03. Similarly, q150MHz shows a redshift evolution following q150 GHz = (1.72 ± 0.04) (1 + z)-0.22 ± 0.05. Calibration of the 150MHz radio luminosity as a star formation rate tracer suggests that a single power-law extrapolation from q1.4 GHz is not an accurate approximation at all redshifts.},

abstract = {We present a current catalog of 21cm H I line sources extracted from the Arecibo Legacy Fast Arecibo L-band Feed Array (ALFALFA) survey over 2800deg 2 of sky: the $\alpha$.40 catalog. Covering 40{\%} of the final survey area, the $\alpha$.40 catalog contains 15,855 sources in the regions 07 h30m {\textless} R.A. {\textless} 16h30m, +04° {\textless} decl. {\textless}+16°, and +24° {\textless} decl. {\textless}+28° and 22 h {\textless} R.A. {\textless} 03h, +14° {\textless} decl. {\textless}+16°, and +24° {\textless} decl. {\textless} + 32°. Of those, 15,041 are certainly extragalactic, yielding a source density of 5.3 galaxies perdeg2, a factor of 29 improvement over the catalog extracted from the H I Parkes All-Sky Survey. In addition to the source centroid positions, H I line flux densities, recessional velocities, and line widths, the catalog includes the coordinates of the most probable optical counterpart of each H I line detection, and a separate compilation provides a cross-match to identifications given in the photometric and spectroscopic catalogs associated with the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 7. Fewer than 2{\%} of the extragalactic H I line sources cannot be identified with a feasible optical counterpart; some of those may be rare OH megamasers at 0.16 {\textless} z {\textless} 0.25. A detailed analysis is presented of the completeness, width-dependent sensitivity function and bias inherent of the $\alpha$.40 catalog. The impact of survey selection, distance errors, current volume coverage, and local large-scale structure on the derivation of the H I mass function is assessed. While $\alpha$.40 does not yet provide a completely representative sampling of cosmological volume, derivations of the H I mass function using future data releases from ALFALFA will further improve both statistical and systematic uncertainties. {\textcopyright} 2011.

abstract = {We review recent determinations of the present day and initial mass functions in various components of the Galaxy, disk, spheroid, young and globular clusters. As a general feature, the IMF is well described by a power-law form for {\$}m\backslashga 1 \backslashmsol{\$} and a lognormal form below. The extension of the disk IMF into the brown dwarf (BD) regime is in good agreement with observations and yields a disk BD number-density comparable to the stellar one {\$}\backslashsim 0.1 \backslashpc3{\$}. The IMF of young clusters is found to be consistent with the disk field IMF, providing the same correction for unresolved binaries. The spheroid IMF relies on much less robust grounds. Within all the uncertainties, it is found to be similar to the one derived for globular clusters, and is well represented also by a lognormal form with a characteristic mass slightly larger than for the disk. The IMF characteristic of early star formation remains undetermined, but different observational constraints suggest that it does not extend below {\$}\backslashsim 1 \backslashmsol{\$}. These IMFs allow a reasonably robust determination of the Galactic present-day and initial stellar and brown dwarf contents. They also have important galactic implications in yielding more accurate mass-to-light ratio determinations. The M/L ratios obtained with the disk and the spheroid IMF yield values 1.8 and 1.4 smaller than a Salpeter IMF, respectively. This general IMF determination is examined in the context of star formation theory. (shortened)},

abstract = {Using free-free emission measured in the Ka band (26-40GHz) for 10 star-forming regions in the nearby galaxy NGC6946, including its starbursting nucleus, we compare a number of star formation rate (SFR) diagnostics that are typically considered to be unaffected by interstellar extinction. These diagnostics include non-thermal radio (i.e., 1.4GHz), total infrared (IR; 8-1000 $\mu$m), and warm dust (i.e., 24 $\mu$m) emission, along with hybrid indicators that attempt to account for obscured and unobscured emission from star-forming regions including H$\alpha$ + 24 $\mu$m and UV + IR measurements. The assumption is made that the 33GHz free-free emission provides the most accurate measure of the current SFR. Among the extranuclear star-forming regions, the 24 $\mu$m, H$\alpha$ + 24 $\mu$m, and UV + IR SFR calibrations are in good agreement with the 33GHz free-free SFRs. However, each of the SFR calibrations relying on some form of dust emission overestimates the nuclear SFR by a factor of ∼2 relative to the 33GHz free-free SFR. This is more likely the result of excess dust heating through an accumulation of non-ionizing stars associated with an extended episode of star formation in the nucleus rather than increased competition for ionizing photons by dust. SFR calibrations using the non-thermal radio continuum yield values which only agree with the 33GHz free-free SFRs for the nucleus and underestimate the SFRs from the extranuclear star-forming regions by an average factor of ∼ 2 and ∼4-5 before and after subtracting local background emission, respectively. This result likely arises from the cosmic-ray (CR) electrons decaying within the starburst region with negligible escape, whereas the transient nature of star formation in the young extranuclear star-forming complexes allows for CR electrons to diffuse significantly further than dust-heating photons, resulting in an underestimate of the true SFR. Finally, we find that the SFRs estimated using the total 33GHz flux density appear to agree well with those estimated using free-free emission due to the large thermal fractions present at these frequencies even when local diffuse backgrounds are not removed. Thus, rest-frame 33GHz observations may act as a reliable method to measure the SFRs of galaxies at increasingly high redshift without the need of ancillary radio data to account for the non-thermal emission. {\textcopyright} 2011 The American Astronomical Society.

abstract = {I have assembled a diverse sample of galaxies from the literature with far-ultraviolet (FUV), optical, infrared (IR), and radio luminosities to explore the calibration of radio-derived and IR-derived star formation (SF) rates and the origin of the radio-IR correlation. By comparing the 8-1000 $\mu$m IR, which samples dust-reprocessed starlight, with direct stellar FUV emission, I show that the IR traces most of the SF in luminous {\~{}}L* galaxies but traces only a small fraction of the SF in faint {\~{}}0.01L* galaxies. If radio emission were a perfect SF rate indicator, this effect would cause easily detectable curvature in the radio-IR correlation. Yet, the radio-IR correlation is nearly linear. This implies that the radio flux from low-luminosity galaxies is substantially suppressed, compared to brighter galaxies. This is naturally interpreted in terms of a decreasing efficiency of nonthermal radio emission in faint galaxies. Thus, the linearity of the radio-IR correlation is a conspiracy: both indicators underestimate the SF rate at low luminosities. SF rate calibrations that take into account this effect are presented, along with estimates of the random and systematic error associated with their use.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017. The American Astronomical Society. All rights reserved. We present new radio continuum observations of NGC 253 from the Murchison Widefield Array at frequencies between 76 and 227 MHz. We model the broadband radio spectral energy distribution for the total flux density of NGC 253 between 76 MHz and 11 GHz. The spectrum is best described as a sum of a central starburst and extended emission. The central component, corresponding to the inner 500 pc of the starburst region of the galaxy, is best modeled as an internally free-free absorbed synchrotron plasma, with a turnover frequency around 230 MHz. The extended emission component of the spectrum of NGC 253 is best described as a synchrotron emission flattening at low radio frequencies. We find that 34{\%} of the extended emission (outside the central starburst region) at 1 GHz becomes partially absorbed at low radio frequencies. Most of this flattening occurs in the western region of the southeast halo, and may be indicative of synchrotron self-absorption of shock-reaccelerated electrons or an intrinsic low-energy cutoff of the electron distribution. Furthermore, we detect the large-scale synchrotron radio halo of NGC 253 in our radio images. At 154-231 MHz the halo displays the well known X-shaped/horn-like structure, and extends out to ∼8 kpc in the z-direction (from the major axis).},

The star formation rate in the model is regulated through ionization of the interstellar hydrogen by massive O,B stars. The volume of a galaxy is determined by the condition of equilibrium between collisional dissipation of turbulent energy of interstellar gas and turbulisation of the gas by supernovae. The modern theory of stellar evolution helps to describe evolution of the stellar component of a galaxy in time and to estimate the current frequency of supernovae. This model reproduces some basic observed parameters of spherical and disk galaxies and their evolution on the Hubble timescale. The role of external factors in evolution of galaxies and possible reasons of a nonstationary star formation in galaxies and their nuclei are shortly discussed.},

Most of our photometry and spectrophotometry is measured from the same region of each galaxy, and our spectrophotometry has been validated with SDSS photometry, so our random and systematic errors are small relative to the intrinsic scatter seen in star formation rate indicator calibrations. We find WISE W4 (22.8 micron), Spitzer 24 micron and 1.4 GHz have tight correlations with Balmer decrement corrected H-alpha luminosity, with scatter of only 0.2 dex. Our calibrations are comparable to those from the prior literature for L* galaxies, but for dwarf galaxies our calibrations can give star formation rates that are far greater than those derived from much of the prior literature.},

@article{Lacki2010,
abstract = {The far-infrared (FIR) and radio luminosities of star-forming galaxies are linearly correlated over a very wide range in star formation rate, from normal spirals like the Milky Way to the most intense starbursts. Using one-zone models of cosmic ray (CR) injection, cooling, and escape in star-forming galaxies, we attempt to reproduce the observed FIR-radio correlation (FRC) over its entire span. The normalization and linearity of the FRC, together with constraints on the CR population in the Milky Way, have strong implications for the CR and magnetic energy densities in star-forming galaxies. We show that for consistency with the FRC, 2{\%} of the kinetic energy from supernova explosions must go into high-energy primary CR electrons and that 10{\%}-20{\%} must go into high-energy primary CR protons. Secondary electrons and positrons are likely comparable to or dominate primary electrons in dense starburst galaxies. We discuss the implications of our models for the magnetic field strengths of starbursts, the detectability of starbursts by Fermi, and CR feedback. Overall, our models indicate that both CR protons and electrons escape from low surface density galaxies, but lose most of their energy before escaping dense starbursts. The FRC is caused by a combination of the efficient cooling of CR electrons (calorimetry) in starbursts and a conspiracy of several factors. For lower surface density galaxies, the decreasing radio emission caused by CR escape is balanced by the decreasing FIR emission caused by the low effective UV dust opacity. In starbursts, bremsstrahlung, ionization, and inverse Compton cooling decrease the radio emission, but they are countered by secondary electrons/positrons and the dependence of synchrotron frequency on energy, both of which increase the radio emission. Our conclusions hold for a broad range of variations in our fiducial model, such as those including winds, different magnetic field strengths, and different diffusive escape times. {\textcopyright} 2010.

abstract = {We have re-analyzed the NRAO VLA Sky Survey (NVSS) data to derive rotation measures (RMs) toward 37,543 polarized radio sources. The resulting catalog of RM values covers the sky area north of declination -40°with an average density of more than one RM per square degree. We present an image of the median RM over 82{\%} of the sky with a resolution of 8° and a typical error of 1-2 rad m -2 . The image shows large-scale structures in RM that extend to very high Galactic latitudes. A simple analysis of the RM structure at high Galactic latitudes is used to derive properties of the Galactic halo magnetic field in the solar neighborhood. We find the component of the local field perpendicular to the plane (the z-component) equal to +0.30 $\mu$G for z {\textless} 0 and -0.14 $\mu$G for z{\textgreater}0. The reversal of sign across the Galactic plane is consistent with a quadrupole field geometry for the poloidal component of the halo field. The halo magnetic field component parallel to the disk is also found to be antisymmetric and generally consistent with a toroidal field, with strength +0.83 $\mu$G for z {\textless} 0 and -0.39 $\mu$G for z{\textgreater}0. We have identified five regions of the sky where the foreground median RM is consistently less than 1 rad m -2 over several degrees. These holes in the foreground RM will be useful for future studies of possible small-scale fluctuations in cosmic magnetic field structures. In addition to allowing measurement of RMs toward polarized sources, the new analysis of the NVSS data removes the effects of bandwidth depolarization for |RM| ≳ 100 rad m -2 inherent in the original NVSS source catalog. This new catalog of RMs and polarized flux densities is available online, and will be a valuable resource for further studies of the Galactic magnetic field and magnetoionic medium, and extragalactic magnetic fields. {\textcopyright} 2009 The American Astronomical Society.

abstract = {Using the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA), the low-frequency Square Kilometre Array precursor located in Western Australia, we have completed the GaLactic and Extragalactic All-sky MWA (GLEAM) survey, and present the resulting extragalactic catalogue, utilizing the first year of observations. The catalogue covers 24 831 square degrees, over declinations south of +30° and Galactic latitudes outside 10° of the Galactic plane, excluding some areas such as theMagellanic Clouds. It contains 307 455 radio sources with 20 separate flux density measurements across 72-231 MHz, selected from a time- and frequency-integrated image centred at 200 MHz, with a resolution of ≈2 arcmin. Over the catalogued region, we estimate that the catalogue is 90 per cent complete at 170 mJy, and 50 per cent complete at 55 mJy, and large areas are complete at even lower flux density levels. Its reliability is 99.97 per cent above the detection threshold of 5$\sigma$, which itself is typically 50 mJy. These observations constitute the widest fractional bandwidth and largest sky area survey at radio frequencies to date, and calibrate the low-frequency flux density scale of the southern sky to better than 10 per cent. This paper presents details of the flagging, imaging, mosaicking and source extraction/characterization, as well as estimates of the completeness and reliability. All source measurements and images are available online. 1 This is the first in a series of publications describing the GLEAM survey results.},

abstract = {A universal initial mass function (IMF) is not intuitive, but so far no convincing evidence for a variable IMF exists. The detection of systematic variations of the IMF with star-forming conditions would be the Rosetta Stone for star formation. In this contribution an average or Galactic-field IMF is defined, stressing that there is evidence for a change in the power-law index at only two masses: near 0.5 M⊙ and near 0.08 M⊙. Using this supposed universal IMF, the uncertainty inherent in any observational estimate of the IMF is investigated by studying the scatter introduced by Poisson noise and the dynamical evolution of star clusters. It is found that this apparent scatter reproduces quite well the observed scatter in power-law index determinations, thus defining the fundamental limit within which any true variation becomes undetectable. The absence of evidence for a variable IMF means that any true variation of the IMF in well-studied populations must be smaller than this scatter. Determinations of the power-law indices $\alpha$ are subject to systematic errors arising mostly from unresolved binaries. The systematic bias is quantified here, with the result that the single-star IMFs for young star clusters are systematically steeper by $\Delta$$\alpha$ ≈ 0.5 between 0.1 and 1 M⊙ than the Galactic-field IMF, which is populated by, on average, about 5-Gyr-old stars. The MFs in globular clusters appear to be, on average, systematically flatter than the Galactic-field IMF (Piotto {\&} Zoccali; Paresce {\&} De Marchi), and the recent detection of ancient white-dwarf candidates in the Galactic halo and the absence of associated low-mass stars (Ibata et al.; M{\'{e}}ndez {\&} Minniti) suggest a radically different IMF for this ancient population. Star formation in higher metallicity environments thus appears to produce relatively more low-mass stars. While still tentative, this is an interesting trend, being consistent with a systematic variation of the IMF as expected from theoretical arguments.},

abstract = {We have acquired radio-continuum data between 70MHz and 48 GHz for a sample of 19 southern starburst galaxies at moderate redshifts (0.067 {\textless} z {\textless} 0.227) with the aim of separating synchrotron and free-free emission components. Using a Bayesian framework, we find the radio continuum is rarely characterized well by a single power law, instead often exhibiting lowfrequency turnovers below 500 MHz, steepening at mid to high frequencies, and a flattening at high frequencies where free-free emission begins to dominate over the synchrotron emission. These higher order curvature components may be attributed to free-free absorption across multiple regions of star formation with varying optical depths. The decomposed synchrotron and free-free emission components in our sample of galaxies form strong correlations with the total-infrared bolometric luminosities. Finally, we find that without accounting for free-free absorption with turnovers between 90 and 500MHz the radio continuum at low frequency (v {\textless} 200 MHz) could be overestimated by upwards of a factor of 12 if a simple power-law extrapolation is used from higher frequencies. The mean synchrotron spectral index of our sample is constrained to be $\alpha$ = -1.06, which is steeper than the canonical value of -0.8 for normal galaxies. We suggest this may be caused by an intrinsically steeper cosmic ray distribution.},

We focus on the luminosity of the [OIII]$\lambda$5007 emission line as a tracer of the strength of activity in the nucleus. We study how AGN host properties compare with those of normal galaxies and how they depend on L[OIII]. We find that AGN of all luminosities reside almost exclusively in massive galaxies and have distributions of sizes, stellar surface mass densities and concentrations that are similar to those of ordinary early-type galaxies in our sample. The host galaxies of low-luminosity AGN have stellar populations similar to normal early types. The hosts of high-luminosity AGN have much younger mean stellar ages. The young stars are not preferentially located near the nucleus of the galaxy, but are spread out over scales of at least several kiloparsecs. A significant fraction of high-luminosity AGN have strong H$\delta$ absorption-line equivalent widths, indicating that they experienced a burst of star formation in the recent past. We have also examined the stellar populations of the host galaxies of a sample of broad-line AGN. We conclude that there is no significant difference in stellar content between type 2 Seyfert hosts and quasars (QSOs) with the same [OIII] luminosity and redshift. This establishes that a young stellar population is a general property of AGN with high [OIII] luminosities.},

abstract = {Radio emission is a key indicator of star-formation activity in galaxies, but the radio luminosity-star formation relation has to date been studied almost exclusively at frequencies of 1.4 GHz or above. At lower radio frequencies the effects of thermal radio emission are greatly reduced, and so we would expect the radio emission observed to be completely dominated by synchrotron radiation from supernova-generated cosmic rays. As part of the LOFAR Surveys Key Science project, the Herschel-ATLAS NGP field has been surveyed with LOFAR at an effective frequency of 150 MHz. We select a sample from the MPA-JHU catalogue of SDSS galaxies in this area: the combination of Herschel, optical and mid-infrared data enable us to derive star-formation rates (SFRs) for our sources using spectral energy distribution fitting, allowing a detailed study of the low-frequency radio luminosity--star-formation relation in the nearby Universe. For those objects selected as star-forming galaxies (SFGs) using optical emission line diagnostics, we find a tight relationship between the 150 MHz radio luminosity ({\$}L{\_}{\{}150{\}}{\$}) and SFR. Interestingly, we find that a single power-law relationship between {\$}L{\_}{\{}150{\}}{\$} and SFR is not a good description of all SFGs: a broken power law model provides a better fit. This may indicate an additional mechanism for the generation of radio-emitting cosmic rays. Also, at given SFR, the radio luminosity depends on the stellar mass of the galaxy. Objects which were not classified as SFGs have higher 150-MHz radio luminosity than would be expected given their SFR, implying an important role for low-level active galactic nucleus activity.},

abstract = {A tight, linear correlation is established between the far-infrared flux measured by IRAS and the nonthermal radio flux density (at 1.4 GHz) from disks of spiral galaxies. This correlation defines a ratio of infrared to radio fluxes that is characteristic of star formation activity. Galaxies with nuclear starbursts seem to follow the correlation. If the far-infrared is reradiated luminosity from young massive stars, then the supernova remnants alone account for less than 10 percent of the radio emission. These results indicate a close coupling between dust heating and cosmic-ray generation and confinement in a wide range of conditions.},

This volume limited, K-band selected sample is composed of galaxies spanning the whole range of morphological types (from ellipticals to late-type spirals) and environments (from the field to the centre of the Virgo Cluster). We present flux density measurements of the whole sample of 323 galaxies of the HRS in the three bands of the Spectral and Photometric Imaging Receiver (SPIRE), at 250 $\mu$m, 350 $\mu$m and 500 $\mu$m. Aperture photometry is performed on extended galaxies and point spread function (PSF) fitting on timeline data for unresolved objects; we carefully estimate errors and upper limits. The flux densities are found to be in good agreement with those of the HeViCS and KINGFISH key projects in all SPIRE bands, and of the Planck consortium at 350 $\mu$m and 550 $\mu$m, for the galaxies in common.

abstract = {Aims.Photometric data of galaxies covering the rest-frame wavelength range from far-UV to far-IR make it possible to derive galaxy properties with a high reliability by fitting the attenuated stellar emission and the related dust emission at the same time. Methods. For this purpose we wrote the code CIGALE (Code Investigating GALaxy Emission) that uses model spectra composed of the Maraston (or PEGASE) stellar population models, synthetic attenuation functions based on a modified Calzetti law, spectral line templates, the Dale {\&} Helou dust emission models, and optional spectral templates of obscured AGN. Depending on the input redshifts, filter fluxes were computed for the model set and compared to the galaxy photometry by carrying out a Bayesian-like analysis. CIGALE was tested by analysing 39 nearby galaxies selected from SINGS. The reliability of the different model parameters was evaluated by studying the resulting expectation values and their standard deviations in relation to the input model grid. Moreover, the influence of the filter set and the quality of photometric data on the code results was estimated. Results.For up to 17 filters with effective wavelengths between 0.15 and 160 $\mu$m, we find robust results for the mass, star formation rate, effective age of the stellar population at 4000 {\AA}, bolometric luminosity, luminosity absorbed by dust, and attenuation in the far-UV. Details of the star formation history (excepting the burst fraction) and the shape of the attenuation curve are difficult to investigate with the available broad-band UV and optical photometric data. A study of the mutual relations between the reliable properties confirms the dependence of star formation activity on morphology in the local Universe and indicates a significant drop in this activity at about 1011 M towards higher total stellar masses. The dustiest galaxies in the SINGS sample are present in the same mass range. On the other hand, the far-UV attenuation of our sample galaxies does not appear to show a significant dependence on star formation activity. {\textcopyright} 2009 ESO.},

abstract = {We combine H$\alpha$ emission-line and infrared (IR) continuum measurements of two samples of nearby galaxies to derive dust attenuation-corrected star formation rates (SFRs). We use a simple energy balance based method that has been applied previously to H II regions in the Spitzer Infrared Nearby Galaxies Survey, and extend the methodology to integrated measurements of galaxies. We find that our composite H$\alpha$ + IR based SFRs are in excellent agreement with attenuation-corrected SFRs derived from integrated spectrophotometry, over the full range of SFRs (0.01-80 M yr-1) and attenuations (0-2.5 mag) studied. We find that the combination of H$\alpha$ and total IR luminosities provides the most robust SFR measurements, but combinations of H$\alpha$ measurements with monochromatic luminosities at 24$\mu$m and 8$\mu$m perform nearly as well. The calibrations differ significantly from those obtained for H II regions, with the difference attributable to a more evolved population of stars heating the dust. Our results are consistent with a significant component of diffuse dust (the "IR cirrus" component) that is heated by a non-star-forming population. The same methodology can be applied to [O II]$\lambda$3727 emission-line measurements, and the radio continuum fluxes of galaxies can be applied in place of IR fluxes when the latter are not available. We assess the precision and systematic reliability of all of these composite methods. {\textcopyright} 2009 The American Astronomical Society. All rights reserved.},

Exploiting Arecibo's large collecting area and small beam size, ALFALFA is specifically designed to probe the faint end of the HI mass function in the local universe and will provide a census of HI in the surveyed sky area to faint flux limits, making it especially useful in synergy with wide area surveys conducted at other wavelengths. ALFALFA will also provide the basis for studies of the dynamics of galaxies within the Local and nearby superclusters, will allow measurement of the HI diameter function, and enable a first wide-area blind search for local HI tidal features, HI absorbers at z {\textless} 0.06 and OH megamasers in the redshift range 0.16 {\textless} z {\textless} 0.25. Although completion of the survey will require some five years, public access to the ALFALFA data and data products will be provided in a timely manner, thus allowing its application for studies beyond those targeted by the ALFALFA collaboration. ALFALFA adopts a two-pass, minimum intrusion, drift scan observing technique which samples the same region of sky at two separate epochs to aid in the discrimination of cosmic signals from noise and terrestrial interference. Survey simulations, which take into account large scale structure in the mass distribution and incorporate experience with the ALFA system gained from tests conducted during its commissioning phase, suggest that ALFALFA will detect on the order of 20,000 extragalactic HI line sources out to z=0.06, including several hundred with HI masses of less than 10{\^{}}{\{}7.5{\}} msun.},

abstract = {Detailed studies of the spectral energy distribution (SED) of normal galaxies have increasingly been used to understand the physical mechanism dominating their integrated emission, mainly owing to the availability of high quality multi-wavelength data from the UV to the far-infrared (FIR). However, systems hosting dust-enshrouded nuclear starbursts and/or an accreting supermassive black hole (an active galactic nucleus or AGN) are especially challenging to study. This is due to the complex interplay between the heating by massive stars and the AGN, the absorption and emission of radiation from dust, as well as the presence of the underlying old stellar population. We used the latest release of CIGALE, a fast state-of-the-art galaxy SED-fitting model relying on energy balance, to study the influence of an AGN in a self consistent manner in estimating both the star formation rate (SFR) and stellar mass in galaxies, as well as to calculate the contribution of the AGN to the power output of the host. Using the semi-analytical galaxy formation model galform, we created a suite of mock galaxy SEDs using realistic star formation histories (SFH). We also added an AGN of Type-1, Type-2, or intermediate-type whose contribution to the bolometric luminosity can be variable. We performed an SED-fitting of these catalogues with CIGALE, assuming three different SFHs: a single-exponentially-decreasing (1$\tau$-dec), a double-exponentially-decreasing (2$\tau$-dec), and a delayed SFH. Constraining the overall contribution of an AGN to the total infrared luminosity (fracAGN) is very challenging for fracAGN{\textless} 20{\%}, with uncertainties of ∼5-30{\%} for higher fractions depending on the AGN type, while FIR and sub-mm are essential. The AGN power has an impact on the estimation of M∗ in Type-1 and intermediate-type AGNs but has no effect on galaxies hosting Type-2 AGNs. We find that in the absence of AGN emission, the best estimates of M∗ are obtained using the 2$\tau$-dec model but at the expense of realistic ages of the stellar population. The delayed SFH model provides good estimates of M∗ and SFR, with a maximum offset of 10{\%} as well as better estimates of the age. Our analysis shows that the under-estimation of the SFR increases with fracAGN for Type-1 systems, as well as for low contributions of an intermediate AGN type, but it is quite insensitive to the emission of Type-2 AGNs up to fracAGN ∼ 45{\%}. A lack of sampling the FIR, or sub-mm domain systematically over-estimates the SFR ({\textless}20{\%}), independent of the contribution of the AGN. Similarly, the UV emission is critical in accurately retrieving both the M∗ for Type-1 and intermediate- type AGN and the SFR of all three AGN types. We show that the presence of AGN emission introduces a scatter to the SFR-M∗ main sequence relation derived from SED-fitting, which is driven by the uncertainties on M∗. Finally, we used our mock catalogues to test the popular IR SED-fitting code DecompIR and show that fracAGN is under-estimated but that the SFR is recovered well for Type-1 and intermediate-types of AGN. The fracAGN, SFR, and LIR estimates of Type-2 AGNs are more problematic owing to a FIR emission disagreement between predicted and observed models.},

The rms noise in the centre of the image is 4-5 mJy beam-1. The MWA counts are in excellent agreement with counts from other instruments and are the most precise ever derived in the flux density range 30-200 mJy due to the sky area covered. Using the deepest available source count data, we find that the MWA image is affected by sidelobe confusion noise at the ≈3.5 mJy beam-1 level, due to incompletely peeled and out-of-image sources, and classical confusion becomes apparent at ≈1.7 mJy beam-1. This work highlights that (i) further improvements in ionospheric calibration and deconvolution imaging techniques would be required to probe to the classical confusion limit and (ii) the shape of low-frequency source counts, including any flattening towards lower flux densities, must be determined from deeper ≈150 MHz surveys as it cannot be directly inferred from higher frequency data.},

The multifrequency data in our hands are used to trace the molecular gas mass distribution and the main scaling relations of the sample, which put strong constraints on galaxy formation simulations. We extend the main scaling relations concerning the total and the molecular gas component determined for massive galaxies (Mstar ≳ 1010 M⊙) from the COLD GASS survey down to stellar masses Mstar ≃ 10 9M⊙. As scaling variables we use the total stellar mass Mstar, the stellar surface density $\mu$star, the specific star formation rate SSFR, and the metallicity of the target galaxies. By comparing molecular gas masses determined using a constant or a luminosity dependent XCO conversion factor, we estimate the robustness of these scaling relations on the very uncertain assumptions used to transform CO line intensities into molecular gas masses. The molecular gas distribution of a K-band-selected sample is significantly different from that of a far-infrared-selected sample since it includes a significantly smaller number of objects with M(H2) ≲ 6 × 109 M ⊙. In spiral galaxies the molecular gas phase is only 25-30{\%} of the atomic gas. The analysis also indicates that the slope of the main scaling relations depends on the adopted conversion factor. Among the sampled relations, all those concerning M(gas)/Mstar are statistically significant and show little variation with XCO. We observe a significant correlation between M(H2)/Mstar and SSFR, M(H2)/M(Hi) and $\mu$star, M(H2)/M(Hi) and 12+log+(O/H), regardless of the adopted XCO. The total and molecular gas consumption timescales are anticorrelated with the specific star formation rate. The comparison of HRS and COLD GASS data indicates that some of the observed scaling relations are nonlinear. {\textcopyright} 2014 ESO .},

abstract = {In high density environments, the gas content of galaxies is stripped, leading to a rapid quenching of their star formation activity. This dramatic environmental effect, which is not related to typical passive evolution, is generally not taken into account in the star formation histories (SFHs) usually assumed to perform spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting of these galaxies, yielding a poor fit of their stellar emission and, consequently, biased estimate of the star formation rate (SFR). In this work, we aim at reproducing this rapid quenching using a truncated delayed SFH that we implemented in the SED fitting code CIGALE. We show that the ratio between the instantaneous SFR and the SFR just before the quenching (rSFR) is well constrained as long as rest-frame UV data are available. This SED modeling is applied to the Herschel Reference Survey (HRS) containing isolated galaxies and sources falling in the dense environment of the Virgo cluster. The latter are Hi-deficient because of ram pressure stripping. We show that the truncated delayed SFH successfully reproduces their SED, while typical SFH assumptions fail. A good correlation is found between rSFR and Hi-def, the parameter that quantifies the gas deficiency of cluster galaxies, meaning that SED fitting results can be used to provide a tentative estimate of the gas deficiency of galaxies for which Hi observations are not available. The HRS galaxies are placed on the SFR-M{\textperiodcentered} diagram showing that the Hi-deficient sources lie in the quiescent region, thus confirming previous studies. Using the rSFR parameter, we derive the SFR of these sources before quenching and show that they were previously on the main sequence relation. We show that the rSFR parameter is also recovered well for deeply obscured high redshift sources, as well as in the absence of IR data. SED fitting is thus a powerful tool for identifying galaxies that underwent a rapid star formation quenching.},

abstract = {Strong constraints on the cosmic star formation history (SFH) have recently been established using ultraviolet and far-infrared measurements, refining the results of numerous measurements over the past decade. Taken together, the most recent and robust data indicate a compellingly consistent picture of the SFH out to redshift z{\~{}}6, with especially tight constraints for z{\textless}{\~{}}1. We fit these data with simple analytical forms, and derive conservative bands to indicate possible variations from the best fits. Since the z{\textless}{\~{}}1 SFH data are quite precise, we investigate the sequence of assumptions and corrections that together affect the SFH normalisation, to test their accuracy, both in this redshift range and beyond. As lower limits on this normalisation, we consider the evolution in stellar mass density, metal mass density, and supernova rate density, finding it unlikely that the SFH normalisation is much lower than indicated by our direct fit. Additionally, predictions from the SFH for supernova type Ia rate densities tentatively suggests delay times of {\~{}}3 Gyr. As a corresponding upper limit on the SFH normalisation, we consider the Super-Kamiokande (SK) limit on the electron antineutrino flux from past core-collapse supernovae, which applies primarily to z{\textless}{\~{}}1. We find consistency with the SFH only if the neutrino temperatures from SN events are relatively modest. Constraints on the assumed initial mass function (IMF) also become apparent. The traditional Salpeter IMF, assumed for convenience by many authors, is known to be a poor representation at low stellar masses ({\textless}{\~{}} 1 solar mass), and we show that recently favoured IMFs are also constrained. In particular, somewhat shallow, or top-heavy, IMFs may be preferred, although they cannot be too top-heavy. (Abridged)},

abstract = {We present GALEX far-ultraviolet (FUV) and near-ultraviolet (NUV) as well as SDSS g, r, i photometry and structural parameters for the Herschel Reference Survey, a magnitude-, volume-limited sample of nearby galaxies in different environments. We use this unique dataset to investigate the ultraviolet (UV) structural scaling relations of nearby galaxies and to determine how the properties of the UV disk vary with atomic hydrogen content and environment. We find a clear change of slope in the stellar mass vs. effective surface brightness relation when moving from the optical to the UV, with more massive galaxies having brighter optical but fainter UV surface brightnesses than smaller systems. A similar change of slope is also seen in the radius vs. surface brightness relation. By comparing our observations with the predictions of a simple multi-zone chemical model of galaxy evolution, we show that these findings are a natural consequence of a much more efficient inside-out growth of the stellar disk in massive galaxies. We confirm that isophotal radii are always a better proxy for the size of the stellar/star-forming disk than effective quantities and we show that the extent of the UV disk (normalized to the optical size) is strongly correlated to the integrated Hi gas fraction. This relation still holds even when cluster spirals are considered, with Hi-deficient systems having less extended star-forming disks than Hi-normal galaxies. Interestingly, the star formation in the inner part of Hi-deficient galaxies is significantly less affected by the removal of the atomic hydrogen, as expected in a simple ram-pressure stripping scenario. These results suggest that it is the amount of Hi that regulates the growth of the star-forming disk in the outskirts of galaxies. {\textcopyright} 2012 ESO.},

abstract = {We present new H$\alpha$+[NII] imaging data of late-type galaxies in the Herschel Reference Survey aimed at studying the star formation properties of a K-band-selected, volume-limited sample of nearby galaxies. The H$\alpha$+[NII] data are corrected for [NII] contamination and dust attenuation using different recipes based on the Balmer decrement and the 24 $\mu$m luminosities.We show that the H$\alpha$ luminosities derived with different corrections give consistent results only whenever the uncertainty on the estimate of the Balmer decrement is $\sigma$[C(H$\beta$)] ≤ 0.1. We used these data to derive the star formation rate of the late-type galaxies of the sample and compare these estimates to those determined using independent monochromatic tracers (far-UV, radio continuum) or the output of spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting codes. This comparison suggests that the 24 $\mu$m based dust extinction correction for the H$\alpha$ data might not be universal and that it should be used with caution in all objects with a low star formation activity, where dust heating can be dominated by the old stellar population. Furthermore, because of the sudden truncation of the star formation activity of cluster galaxies occurring after their interaction with the surrounding environment, the stationarity conditions required to transform monochromatic fluxes into star formation rates might not always be satisfied in tracers other than the H$\alpha$ luminosity. In a similar way, the parametrisation of the star formation history generally used in SED fitting codes might not be adequate for these recently interacting systems. We then use the derived star formation rates to study the star formation rate luminosity distribution and the typical scaling relations of the late-type galaxies of the HRS.We observe a systematic decrease of the specific star formation rate with increasing stellar mass, stellar mass surface density, and metallicity. We also observe an increase of the asymmetry and smoothness parameters measured in the H$\alpha$-band with increasing specific star formation rate, probably induced by an increase of the contribution of giant HII regions to the H$\alpha$ luminosity function in star-forming low-luminosity galaxies.},

abstract = {A major amendment in recent models of hierarchical galaxy formation is the inclusion of so-called active galactic nucleus (AGN) feedback. The energy input from an active central massive black hole is invoked to suppress star formation in early-type galaxies at later epochs. A major problem is that this process is poorly understood, and compelling observational evidence for its mere existence is still missing. In search for signatures of AGN feedback, we have compiled a sample of 16 000 early-type galaxies in the redshift range 0.05 {\textless} z {\textless} 0.1 from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) data base (MOSES: Morphologically Selected Ellipticals in SDSS). Key in our approach is the use of a purely morphological selection criterion through visual inspection which produces a sample that is not biased against recent star formation and nuclear activity. Based on the nebular emission-line characteristics we separate between star formation activity, black hole activity, the composite of the two and quiescence. We find that emission is mostly LINER (low ionization nuclear emission line region) like in high-mass galaxies ($\sigma$ {\textgreater} 200 km s -1) and roughly evenly distributed between star formation and AGN at intermediate and low ($\sigma$ {\textless} 100 km s -1) masses. The objects with emission (∼20 per cent) are offset from the red sequence and form a well-defined pattern in the colour-mass diagram. Star-forming early-types inhabit the blue cloud, while early-types with AGN are located considerably closer to and almost on the red sequence. Star formation-AGN composites are found right between these two extremes. We further derive galaxy star formation histories using a novel method that combines multiwavelength photometry from near-ultraviolet (UV) to near-infrared (IR) and stellar absorption indices. We find that in those objects deviating from the red sequence star formation occurred several 100 Myr in the past involving 1-10 per cent of the total stellar mass. We identify an evolutionary sequence from star formation via nuclear activity to quiescence. This transition process lasts about 1 Gyr, and the peak AGN phase occurs roughly half a Gyr after the starburst. The most likely interpretation is that star formation is suppressed by nuclear activity in these objects before they settle on the red sequence. This is empirical evidence for the occurrence of AGN feedback in early-type galaxies at recent epochs. {\textcopyright} 2007 The Authors. Journal compilation {\textcopyright} 2007 RAS.},

abstract = {Active galactic nuclei (AGN) are energetic astrophysical sources powered by accretion onto supermassive black holes in galaxies, and present unique observational signatures that cover the full electromagnetic spectrum over more than twenty orders of magnitude in frequency. The rich phenomenology of AGN has resulted in a large number of different “flavours” in the literature that now comprise a complex and confusing AGN “zoo”. It is increasingly clear that these classifications are only partially related to intrinsic differences between AGN and primarily reflect variations in a relatively small number of astrophysical parameters as well the method by which each class of AGN is selected. Taken together, observations in different electromagnetic bands as well as variations over time provide complementary windows on the physics of different sub-structures in the AGN. In this review, we present an overview of AGN multi-wavelength properties with the aim of painting their “big picture” through observations in each electromagnetic band from radio to $\gamma$-rays as well as AGN variability. We address what we can learn from each observational method, the impact of selection effects, the physics behind the emission at each wavelength, and the potential for future studies. To conclude, we use these observations to piece together the basic architecture of AGN, discuss our current understanding of unification models, and highlight some open questions that present opportunities for future observational and theoretical progress.},

abstract = {Accurate far-infrared (FIR) and 1.49 GHz radio flux densities of optically selected spiral and irregular gal- axies brighter than BT = +12 and of infrared-selected galaxies stronger than S = 5.24 Jy at 60 //m were used to derive FIR-radio luminosity correlations for two statistically complete samples spanning a wide luminosity range. The observed correlations are tight but not linear, and the observed scatter is primarily intrinsic, with negligible broadening from measurement errors. Published methods to improve (linearize and tighten) the observed FIR-radio correlation by subtracting the (presumed) radio-quiet infrared cirrus or by compensating for cosmic-ray diffusion losses do not work for both samples simultaneously. An empirical correction to the radio luminosities based on the observed blue luminosities was found that makes the corrected FIR-radio correlation linear and eliminates most of the residual variance. We propose a two-component model for the heating luminosity within galaxies consistent with the improved correlation: (1) a radio-loud component con- taining young ({\textless}3 x 107 yr) massive (M {\textgreater} 8 M0) stars that heats the warm dust and contributes significantly to the diffuse interstellar radiation field that heats the cool cirrus dust plus (2) a radio-quiet component com- prised of older stars with M {\textless} 8 M0. The present data cannot rule out either of the two physical interpreta- tions of this improved correlation, but suggested radio flux-density measurements of selected galaxies at higher frequencies should be able to.

At 154 MHz, the image resolution is approximately 2.5 × 2.2/cos ($\delta$ + 26.7°) arcmin with sensitivity to structures up to {\~{}} 10° in angular size. We provide tables to calculate the expected thermal noise for GLEAM mosaics depending on pointing and frequency and discuss limitations to achieving theoretical noise in Stokes I images.

abstract = {We take advantage of the first data from the Sydney-AAO Multi-object Integral field Galaxy Survey to investigate the relation between the kinematics of gas and stars, and stellar mass in a comprehensive sample of nearby galaxies. We find that all 235 objects in our sample, regardless of their morphology, lie on a tight relation linking stellar mass (M∗) to internal velocity quantified by the S0.5 parameter, which combines the contribution of both dispersion ($\sigma$) and rotational velocity (Vrot) to the dynamical support of a galaxy (S0.5 = √ 0.5 Vrot2 + $\sigma$2). Our results are independent of the baryonic component from which $\sigma$ and V rot are estimated, as the S 0.5 of stars and gas agree remarkably well. This represents a significant improvement compared to the canonical M∗ versus Vrot and M∗ versus $\sigma$ relations. Not only is no sample pruning necessary, but also stellar and gas kinematics can be used simultaneously, as the effect of asymmetric drift is taken into account once Vrot and $\sigma$ are combined. Our findings illustrate how the combination of dispersion and rotational velocities for both gas and stars can provide us with a single dynamical scaling relation valid for galaxies of all morphologies across at least the stellar mass range 8.5 {\textless}log (M∗/M⊙) {\textless} 11. Such relation appears to be more general and at least as tight as any other dynamical scaling relation, representing a unique tool for investigating the link between galaxy kinematics and baryonic content, and a less biased comparison with theoretical models.},

abstract = {We consider an all-sky sample of 1029 Local Volume (LV) galaxies situated within a distance of 11 Mpc. Majority of them have precise distances and estimates of hydrogen mass fraction and star-formation rate derived from far-ultraviolet or H$\alpha$ fluxes. To describe an environment, we attribute two dimensionless values: the density contrast created by the most significant neighbour and the local density contrast produced by all neighbours within a separation of 1 Mpc. The hydrogen mass fraction exhibits a weak effect of HI deficiency being the most pronounced for irregular dwarf galaxies. The specific star formation rate (sSFR) is more sensitive to the environment than the hydrogen mass fraction. Almost all (99 per cent) LV galaxies have their sSFRs below -9.4 dex (yr-1). We notice that irregular dwarfs as well as late-type bulgeless galaxies are capable of reproducing their stellar mass with the observed sSFR over the cosmic time. Thus, the transformation of gas into stars in dIrs and spiral discs is rather sluggish unlike that in E, S0, dSph galaxies, whose star formation history has been stormy and short. The SFR(H$\alpha$)-to-SFR(FUV) scatter ratio increases from Sc, Sd, Sm galaxies towards BCD, Im, Ir types which favours the idea of bursty star formations in lowmass galaxies. However, this bursty activity is caused rather by internal processes than by an external tidal action. A fraction of quenched E, S0, dSph galaxies increases from {\~{}}5 per cent in the field up to {\~{}}50 per cent in the densest regions.},

abstract = {The star-formation history (SFH) of galaxies is a key assumption to derive their physical properties and can lead to strong biases. In this work, we derive the SFH of main sequence (MS) galaxies and show how the peak SFH of a galaxy depends on its seed mass at, for example, z = 5. This seed mass reflects the galaxy's underlying dark matter (DM) halo environment. We show that, following the MS, galaxies undergo a drastic slow down of their stellar mass growth after reaching the peak of their SFH. According to abundance matching, these masses correspond to hot and massive DM halos which state could result in less efficient gas inflows on the galaxies and thus could be the origin of limited stellar mass growth. As a result, we show that galaxies, still on the MS, can enter the passive region of the UVJ diagram while still forming stars. The best fit to the MS SFH is provided by a right skew peak function for which we provide parameters depending on the seed mass of the galaxy. The ability of the classical analytical SFHs to retrieve the star-formation rate (SFR) of galaxies from spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting is studied. Due to mathematical limitations, the exponentially declining and delayed SFH struggle to model high SFR, which starts to be problematic at z {\textgreater} 2. The exponentially rising and log-normal SFHs exhibit the opposite behavior with the ability to reach very high SFR, and thus model starburst galaxies, but they are not able to model low values such as those expected at low redshift for massive galaxies. By simulating galaxies SED from the MS SFH, we show that these four analytical forms recover the SFR of MS galaxies with an error dependent on the model and the redshift. They are, however, sensitive enough to probe small variations of SFR within the MS, with an error ranging from 5 to 40{\%} depending on the SFH assumption and redshift; but all the four fail to recover the SFR of rapidly quenched galaxies. However, these SFHs lead to an artificial gradient of age, parallel to the MS, which is not exhibited by the simulated sample. This gradient is also produced on real data as we show using a sample of real galaxies with redshifts between 1.5 and 2.5. Here, we propose an SFH composed of a delayed form to model the bulk of stellar population with the addition of a flexibility in the recent SFH. This SFH provides very good estimates of the SFR of MS, starbursts, and rapidly quenched galaxies at all redshift. Furthermore, when used on the real sample, the age gradient disappears which show its dependency on the SFH assumption made to perform the SED fitting.},

abstract = {Although it accounts only for a small fraction of the baryonic mass, dust has a profound impact on the physical processes at play in galaxies. Thus, to understand the evolution of galaxies, it is essential not only to characterize dust properties per se, but also in relation to global galaxy properties. To do so, we derive the dust properties of galaxies in a volume limited, K-band selected sample, the Herschel Reference Survey (HRS). We gather infrared photometric data from 8 $\mu$m to 500$\mu$ m from Spitzer, WISE, IRAS, and Herschel for all of the HRS galaxies. Draine {\&} Li (2007, ApJ, 663, 866) models are fit to the data from which the stellar contribution has been carefully removed. We find that our photometric coverage is sufficient to constrain all of the parameters of the Draine {\&} Li models and that a strong constraint on the 20-60$\mu$ $\mu$m range is mandatory to estimate the relative contribution of the photo-dissociation regions to the infrared spectral energy distribution (SED). The SED models tend to systematically underestimate the observed 500$\mu$ $\mu$m flux densities, especially for low-mass systems. We provide the output parameters for all of the galaxies, i.e., the minimum intensity of the interstellar radiation field, the fraction of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH), the relative contribution of PDR and evolved stellar population to the dust heating, the dust mass, and the infrared luminosity. For a subsample of gas-rich galaxies, we analyze the relations between these parameters and the main integrated properties of galaxies, such as stellar mass, star formation rate, infraredluminosity, metallicity, H$\alpha$ and H-band surface brightness, and the far-ultraviolet attenuation. A good correlation between the fraction of PAH and the metallicity is found, implying a weakening of the PAH emission in galaxies with low metallicities and, thus, low stellar masses. The intensity of the diffuse interstellar radiation field and the H-band and H$\alpha$ surface brightnesses are correlated, suggesting that the diffuse dust component is heated by both the young stars in star-forming regions and the diffuse evolved population. We use these results to provide a new set of infrared templates calibrated with Herschel observations on nearby galaxies and a mean SED template to provide the z = 0 reference for cosmological studies. For the same purpose, we place our sample on the SFR-M* diagram. The templates are compared to the most popular infrared SED libraries, enlightening a large discrepancy between all of them in the 20-100$\mu$ $\mu$m range. {\textcopyright} 2014 ESO.},

The two longer-wavelength arrays use detectors with poor photometric stability, but a system of onboard stimulators used for relative calibration, combined with a unique data pipeline, produce good photometry with rms relative errors of less than 10{\%}.},

abstract = {Over the past two decades, an avalanche of data from multiwavelength imaging and spectroscopic surveys has revolutionized our view of galaxy formation and evolution. Here we review the range of complementary techniques and theoretical tools that allow astronomers to map the cosmic history of star formation, heavy element production, and reionization of the Universe from the cosmic "dark ages" to the present epoch. A consistent picture is emerging, whereby the star-formation rate density peaked approximately 3.5 Gyr after the Big Bang, at z{\~{}}1.9, and declined exponentially at later times, with an e-folding timescale of 3.9 Gyr. Half of the stellar mass observed today was formed before a redshift z = 1.3. About 25{\%} formed before the peak of the cosmic star-formation rate density, and another 25{\%} formed after z = 0.7. Less than {\~{}}1{\%} of today's stars formed during the epoch of reionization. Under the assumption of a universal initial mass function, the global stellar mass density inferred at any epoch matches reasonably well the time integral of all the preceding star-formation activity. The comoving rates of star formation and central black hole accretion follow a similar rise and fall, offering evidence for co-evolution of black holes and their host galaxies. The rise of the mean metallicity of the Universe to about 0.001 solar by z = 6, one Gyr after the Big Bang, appears to have been accompanied by the production of fewer than ten hydrogen Lyman-continuum photons per baryon, a rather tight budget for cosmological reionization.},

abstract = {We present Herschel/PACS 100 and 160 $\mu$m integrated photometry for the 323 galaxies in the Herschel Reference Survey (HRS), a K-band, volume-limited sample of galaxies in the local Universe. Once combined with the Herschel/SPIRE observations already available, these data make the HRS the largest representative sample of nearby galaxies with homogeneous coverage across the 100-500 $\mu$m wavelength range. In this paper, we take advantage of this unique data set to investigate the properties and shape of the far-infrared/submillimetre spectral energy distribution in nearby galaxies. We show that, in the stellar mass range covered by the HRS (8 ≤ log (M*/M⊙) ≤ 12), the far-infrared/submillimetre colours are inconsistent with a single modified blackbody having the same dust emissivity index $\beta$ for all galaxies. In particular, either $\beta$ decreases or multiple temperature components are needed, when moving from metal-rich/gas-poor to metal-poor/gas-rich galaxies. We thus investigate how the dust temperature and mass obtained from a single modified blackbody depend on the assumptions made on $\beta$. We show that, while the correlations between dust temperature, galaxy structure and star formation rate are strongly model dependent, the dust mass scaling relations are much more reliable, and variations of $\beta$ only change the strength of the observed trends. {\textcopyright} 2014 The Authors Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Royal Astronomical Society.},

Specifically, we exploit the model-independent approach by Mancuso et al. (2016a,b) to compute the star formation rate functions, the AGN duty cycles and the conditional probability of a star-forming galaxy to host an AGN with given bolometric luminosity. Coupling these ingredients with the radio emission properties associated to star formation and nuclear activity, we compute relevant statistics at different radio frequencies, and disentangle the relative con- tribution of star-forming galaxies and AGNs in different radio luminosity, radio flux, and redshift ranges. Finally, we highlight that radio-emitting star-forming galaxies and AGNs are expected to host supermassive black holes accreting with different Eddington ratio distributions, and to occupy different loci in the galaxy main sequence diagrams. These specific predictions are consistent with current datasets, but need to be tested with larger statistics via future radio data with multi-band coverage on wide areas, as it will become routinely achievable with the advent of the SKA and its precursors.},

Methods. We cross-match the 60-um selected Revised IRAS Faint Source Survey Redshift (RIFSCz) catalogue and the 150-MHz selected LOFAR value-added source catalogue in the Hobby-Eberly Telescope Dark Energy Experiment (HETDEX) Spring Field. We estimate L150 for the cross-matched sources and compare it with the total infrared (IR) luminosity, LIR, and various SFR tracers. Results. We find a tight linear correlation between log L150 and log LIR for star-forming galaxies, with a slope of 1.37. The median qIR value (defined as the logarithm of the LIR to L150 ratio) and its rms scatter of our main sample are 2.14 and 0.34, respectively. We also find that log L150 correlates tightly with the logarithm of SFR derived from three different tracers, i.e., SFR{\_}Halpha based on the Halpha line luminosity, SFR{\_}60 based on the rest-frame 60-um luminosity and SFR{\_}IR based on LIR, with a scatter of 0.3 dex. Our best-fit relations between L150 and these SFR tracers are, log L150 (Lsun) = 1.35(0.06) x log SFR{\_}Halpha (Msun/yr) + 3.20(0.06), log L150 (Lsun) = 1.31(0.05) x log SFR{\_}60 (Msun/yr) + 3.14(0.06), and log L150 (Lsun) = 1.37(0.05) x log SFR{\_}IR (Msun/yr) + 3.09(0.05), which show excellent agreement with each other.},

We find that the IRX-corrected FUV luminosities are tightly and linearly correlated with the attenuation-corrected H$\alpha$ luminosities (as measured from the Balmer decrement), with an rms scatter of ±0.09dex. The ratios of these attenuation-corrected FUV to H$\alpha$ luminosities are consistent with evolutionary synthesis model predictions, assuming a constant star formation rate over 100Myr, solar metallicity, and either a Salpeter or a Kroupa initial mass function with lower and upper mass limits of 0.1 and 100M ⊙. The IRX-corrected FUV to Balmer-corrected H$\alpha$ luminosity ratios do not show any trend with other galactic properties over the ranges covered by our sample objects. In contrast, FUV attenuation derived from the FUV-NUV color (UV spectral slope) show much larger random and systematic uncertainties. When compared to either Balmer-corrected H$\alpha$ luminosities or IRX-corrected FUV luminosities the color-corrected FUV luminosities show ∼2.5times larger rms scatter, and systematic nonlinear deviations as functions of luminosity and other parameters. Linear combinations of 25$\mu$m and 1.4GHz radio continuum luminosities with the observed FUV luminosities are also well correlated with the Balmer-corrected H$\alpha$ luminosities. These results provide useful prescriptions for deriving attenuation-corrected star formation rates of galaxies based on linear combinations of UV and IR or radio luminosities, which are presented in convenient tabular form. Comparisons of our calibrations with attenuation corrections in the literature and with dust attenuation laws are also made. {\textcopyright} 2011. The American Astronomical Society.

abstract = {The radio and far-infrared luminosities of star-forming galaxies are tightly correlated over several orders of magnitude; this is known as the far-infrared radio correlation (FIRC). Previous studies have shown that a host of factors conspire to maintain a tight and linear FIRC, despite many models predicting deviation. This discrepancy between expectations and observations is concerning since a linear FIRC underpins the use of radio luminosity as a star-formation rate indicator. Using LOFAR 150MHz, FIRST 1.4 GHz, and Herschel infrared luminosities derived from the new LOFAR/H-ATLAS catalogue, we investigate possible variation in the monochromatic ( 250 $\mu$m) FIRC at low and high radio frequencies. We use statistical techniques to probe the FIRC for an optically selected sample of 4082 emission-line classified star-forming galaxies as a function of redshift, effective dust temperature, stellarmass, specific star formation rate, and mid-infrared colour (an empirical proxy for specific star formation rate). Although the average FIRC at high radio frequency is consistent with expectations based on a standard power-law radio spectrum, the average correlation at 150MHzis not. We see evidence for redshift evolution of the FIRC at 150 MHz, and find that the FIRC varies with stellar mass, dust temperature, and specific star formation rate, whether the latter is probed using MAGPHYS fitting, or using mid-infrared colour as a proxy. We can explain the variation, to within 1$\sigma$, seen in the FIRC over mid-infrared colour by a combination of dust temperature, redshift, and stellar mass using a Bayesian partial correlation technique.},

abstract = {We have modeled a large sample of infrared starburst galaxies using both the PEGASE v2.0 and STARBURST99 codes to generate the spectral energy distribution of the young star clusters. PEGASE utilizes the Padova group tracks while STARBURST99 uses the Geneva group tracks, allowing comparison between the two. We used our MAPPINGS III code to compute photoionization models which include a self-consistent treatment of dust physics and chemical depletion. We use the standard optical diagnostic diagrams as indicators of the hardness of the EUV radiation field in these galaxies. These diagnostic diagrams are most sensitive to the spectral index of the ionizing radiation field in the 1-4 Rydberg region. We find that warm infrared starburst galaxies contain a relatively hard EUV field in this region. The PEGASE ionizing stellar continuum is harder in the 1-4 Rydberg range than that of STARBURST99. As the spectrum in this regime is dominated by emission from Wolf-Rayet (W-R) stars, this difference is most likely due to the differences in stellar atmosphere models used for the W-R stars. We believe that the stellar atmospheres in STARBURST99 are more applicable to the starburst galaxies in our sample, however they do not produce the hard EUV field in the 1-4 Rydberg region required by our observations. The inclusion of continuum metal blanketing in the models may be one solution. Supernova remnant (SNR) shock modeling shows that the contribution by mechanical energy from SNRs to the photoionization models is {\textless}{\textless} 20{\%}. The models presented here are used to derive a new theoretical classification scheme for starbursts and AGN galaxies based on the optical diagnostic diagrams.},

abstract = {We combine dust, atomic (H i) and molecular (H2) hydrogen mass measurements for 176 galaxies in the Herschel Reference Survey to investigate the effect of environment on the gas-to-dust mass (Mgas/Mdust) ratio of nearby galaxies. We find that, at fixed stellar mass, the average Mgas/Mdust ratio varies by no more than a factor of {\~{}}2 when moving from field to cluster galaxies, with Virgo galaxies being slightly more dust rich (per unit of gas) than isolated systems. Remarkably, once the molecular and atomic hydrogen phases are investigated separately, we find that H i-deficient galaxies have at the same time lower MHI/Mdust ratio but higher MH2/ Mdust ratio than H i-normal systems. In other words, they are poorer in atomic but richer in molecular hydrogen if normalized to their dust content. By comparing our findings with the predictions of theoretical models, we show that the opposite behaviour observed in the MHI/Mdust and MH2/Mdust ratios is fully consistent with outside-in stripping of the interstellar medium (ISM), and is simply a consequence of the different distribution of dust, H i and H2 across the disc. Our results demonstrate that the small environmental variations in the total Mgas/Mdust ratio, as well as in the gas-phase metallicity, do not automatically imply that environmental mechanisms are not able to affect the dust and metal content of the ISM in galaxies.},

@article{Chyzy2018,
abstract = {Aims: The shape of low-frequency radio continuum spectra of normal galaxies is not well understood, the key question being the role of physical processes such as thermal absorption in shaping them. In this work we take advantage of the LOFAR Multifrequency Snapshot Sky Survey (MSSS) to investigate such spectra for a large sample of nearby star-forming galaxies. Methods: Using the measured 150 MHz flux densities from the LOFAR MSSS survey and literature flux densities at various frequencies we have obtained integrated radio spectra for 106 galaxies characterised by different morphology and star formation rate. The spectra are explained through the use of a three-dimensional model of galaxy radio emission, and radiation transfer dependent on the galaxy viewing angle and absorption processes. Results: Our galaxies' spectra are generally flatter at lower compared to higher frequencies: the median spectral index $\alpha$low measured between ≈50 MHz and 1.5 GHz is -0.57 ± 0.01 while the high-frequency one $\alpha$high, calculated between 1.3 GHz and 5 GHz, is -0.77 ± 0.03. As there is no tendency for the highly inclined galaxies to have more flattened low-frequency spectra, we argue that the observed flattening is not due to thermal absorption, contradicting the suggestion of Israel {\&} Mahoney (1990, ApJ, 352, 30). According to our modelled radio maps for M 51-like galaxies, the free-free absorption effects can be seen only below 30 MHz and in the global spectra just below 20 MHz, while in the spectra of starburst galaxies, like M 82, the flattening due to absorption is instead visible up to higher frequencies of about 150 MHz. Starbursts are however scarce in the local Universe, in accordance with the weak spectral curvature seen in the galaxies of our sample. Locally, within galactic disks, the absorption effects are distinctly visible in M 51-like galaxies as spectral flattening around 100-200 MHz in the face-on objects, and as turnovers in the edge-on ones, while in M 82-like galaxies there are strong turnovers at frequencies above 700 MHz, regardless of viewing angle. Conclusions: Our modelling of galaxy spectra suggests that the weak spectral flattening observed in the nearby galaxies studied here results principally from synchrotron spectral curvature due to cosmic ray energy losses and propagation effects. We predict much stronger effects of thermal absorption in more distant galaxies with high star formation rates. Some influence exerted by the Milky Way's foreground on the spectra of all external galaxies is also expected at very low frequencies.},

Our new catalog of the IR flux-limited (S60$\mu$m{\textgreater}=2 Jy) complete sample of 1809 galaxies lists accurate radio positions, redshifts, and 1.4 GHz radio and IRAS fluxes. This sample is 6 times larger in size and 5 times deeper in redshift coverage (to z{\~{}}0.15) than those used in earlier studies of the radio and far-IR (FIR) properties of galaxies in the local volume. The well-known radio-FIR correlation is obeyed by the overwhelming majority ({\textgreater}=98{\%}) of the IR-selected galaxies, and the radio AGNs identified by their excess radio emission constitute only about 1{\%} of the sample, independent of the IR luminosity. These FIR-selected galaxies can account for the entire population of late-type field galaxies in the local volume, and their radio continuum may be used directly to infer the extinction-free star formation rate in most cases. Both the 1.4 GHz radio and 60 $\mu$m IR luminosity functions are reasonably well described by linear sums of two Schechter functions, one representing normal, late-type field galaxies and the other representing starbursts and other luminous IR galaxies. The integrated FIR luminosity density for the local volume is (4.8+/-0.5)×107 Lsolar Mpc-3, less than 10{\%} of which is contributed by the luminous IR galaxies with LFIR{\textgreater}=1011 Lsolar.

This release makes public data taken by SDSS-IV in its first two years of operation (July 2014-2016). Like all previous SDSS releases, DR14 is cumulative, including the most recent reductions and calibrations of all data taken by SDSS since the first phase began operations in 2000. New in DR14 is the first public release of data from the extended Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (eBOSS); the first data from the second phase of the Apache Point Observatory (APO) Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE-2), including stellar parameter estimates from an innovative data driven machine learning algorithm known as "The Cannon"; and almost twice as many data cubes from the Mapping Nearby Galaxies at APO (MaNGA) survey as were in the previous release (N = 2812 in total). This paper describes the location and format of the publicly available data from SDSS-IV surveys. We provide references to the important technical papers describing how these data have been taken (both targeting and observation details) and processed for scientific use. The SDSS website (www.sdss.org) has been updated for this release, and provides links to data downloads, as well as tutorials and examples of data use. SDSS-IV is planning to continue to collect astronomical data until 2020, and will be followed by SDSS-V.},

abstract = {Context. Radio continuum (RC) emission in galaxies allows us to measure star formation rates (SFRs) unaffected by extinction due to dust, of which the low-frequency part is uncontaminated from thermal (free-free) emission. Aims. We calibrate the conversion from the spatially resolved 140 MHz RC emission to the SFR surface density ($\Sigma$SFR) at 1 kpc scale. Radio spectral indices give us, by means of spectral ageing, a handle on the transport of cosmic rays using the electrons as a proxy for GeV nuclei. Methods. We used recent observations of three galaxies (NGC 3184, 4736, and 5055) from the LOFAR Two-metre Sky Survey (LoTSS), and archival LOw-Frequency ARray (LOFAR) data of NGC 5194. Maps were created with the facet calibration technique and converted to radio $\Sigma$SFR maps using the Condon relation. We compared these maps with hybrid $\Sigma$SFR maps from a combination of GALEX far-ultraviolet and Spitzer 24 $\mu$m data using plots tracing the relation at the highest angular resolution allowed by our data at 1.2 × 1.2 kpc 2 resolution. Results. The RC emission is smoothed with respect to the hybrid $\Sigma$SFR owing to the transport of cosmic-ray electrons (CREs) away from star formation sites. This results in a sublinear relation ($\Sigma$SFR)RC [($\Sigma$SFR)hyb] a , where a = 0.59 ± 0.13 (140 MHz) and a = 0.75 ± 0.10 (1365 MHz). Both relations have a scatter of $\sigma$ = 0.3 dex. If we restrict ourselves to areas of young CREs ($\alpha$ {\textgreater} -0.65; I$\nu$ $\nu$ $\alpha$ ), the relation becomes almost linear at both frequencies with a 0.9 and a reduced scatter of $\sigma$ = 0.2 dex. We then simulate the effect of CRE transport by convolving the hybrid $\Sigma$SFR maps with a Gaussian kernel until the RC-SFR relation is linearised; CRE transport lengths are l = 1-5 kpc. Solving the CRE diffusion equation, assuming dominance of the synchrotron and inverse-Compton losses, we find diffusion coefficients of D = (0.13-1.5) × 10 28 cm 2 s -1 at 1 GeV. Conclusions. A RC-SFR relation at 1.4 GHz can be exploited to measure SFRs at redshift z 10 using 140 MHz observations.},

abstract = {The Spectral and Photometric Imaging REceiver (SPIRE), is the Herschel Space Observatory's submillimetre camera and spectrometer. It contains a three-band imaging photometer operating at 250, 350 and 500 $\mu$m, and an imaging Fourier-transform spectrometer (FTS) which covers simultaneously its whole operating range of 194-671 $\mu$m (447-1550 GHz). The SPIRE detectors are arrays of feedhorn-coupled bolometers cooled to 0.3 K. The photometer has a field of view of 4′ × 8′, observed simultaneously in the three spectral bands. Its main operating mode is scan-mapping, whereby the field of view is scanned across the sky to achieve full spatial sampling and to cover large areas if desired. The spectrometer has an approximately circular field of view with a diameter of 2.6′. The spectral resolution can be adjusted between 1.2 and 25 GHz by changing the stroke length of the FTS scan mirror. Its main operating mode involves a fixed telescope pointing with multiple scans of the FTS mirror to acquire spectral data. For extended source measurements, multiple position offsets are implemented by means of an internal beam steering mirror to achieve the desired spatial sampling and by rastering of the telescope pointing to map areas larger than the field of view. The SPIRE instrument consists of a cold focal plane unit located inside the Herschel cryostat and warm electronics units, located on the spacecraft Service Module, for instrument control and data handling. Science data are transmitted to Earth with no on-board data compression, and processed by automatic pipelines to produce calibrated science products. The in-flight performance of the instrument matches or exceeds predictions based on pre-launch testing and modelling: the photometer sensitivity is comparable to or slightly better than estimated pre-launch, and the spectrometer sensitivity is also better by a factor of 1.5-2. {\textcopyright} ESO 2010.},

abstract = {The evolutionary significance of the observed luminosity function for main-sequence stars in the solar neighborhood is discussed. The hypothesis is made that stars move off the main sequence after burning about 10 per cent of their hydrogen mass and that stars have been created at a uniform rate in the solar neighborhood for the last five billion years. Using this hypothesis and the observed luminosity function, the rate of star creation as a function of stellar mass is calculated. The total number and mass of stars which have moved off the main sequence is found to be comparable with the total number of white dwarfs and with the total mass of all fainter main-sequence stars, respectively.},

abstract = {This paper describes the Seventh Data Release of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), marking the completion of the original goals of the SDSS and the end of the phase known as SDSS-II. It includes 11,663deg2 of imaging data, with most of the 2000deg2 increment over the previous data release lying in regions of low Galactic latitude. The catalog contains five-band photometry for 357million distinct objects. The survey also includes repeat photometry on a 120° long, 25 wide stripe along the celestial equator in the Southern Galactic Cap, with some regions covered by as many as 90individual imaging runs. We include a co-addition of the best of these data, going roughly 2mag fainter than the main survey over 250deg2. The survey has completed spectroscopy over 9380deg2; the spectroscopy is now complete over a large contiguous area of the Northern Galactic Cap, closing the gap that was present in previous data releases. There are over 1.6million spectra in total, including 930,000galaxies, 120,000quasars, and 460,000stars. The data release includes improved stellar photometry at low Galactic latitude. The astrometry has all been recalibrated with the second version of the USNO CCD Astrograph Catalog, reducing the rms statistical errors at the bright end to 45milliarcseconds per coordinate. We further quantify a systematic error in bright galaxy photometry due to poor sky determination; this problem is less severe than previously reported for the majority of galaxies. Finally, we describe a series of improvements to the spectroscopic reductions, including better flat fielding and improved wavelength calibration at the blue end, better processing of objects with extremely strong narrow emission lines, and an improved determination of stellar metallicities. {\textcopyright} 2009.

We present new empirical calibrations to estimate resolved and integrated total infrared luminosities from Spitzer and Herschel bands used as monochromatic or combined tracers. We base our calibrations on resolved elements of nearby galaxies (3 to 30 Mpc) observed with Herschel. We perform a resolved spectral energy distribution (SED) modelling of these objects using the Draine {\&} Li dust models and investigate the influence of the addition of Spectral and Photometric Imaging Receiver (SPIRE) measurements in the estimation of LTIR. We find that using data up to 250 $\mu$m leads to local LTIR values consistent with those obtained with a complete coverage (up to 500 $\mu$m) within ±10 per cent for most of our resolved elements. We then study the distribution of energy in the resolved SEDs of our galaxies. The bulk of energy (30-50 per cent) is contained in the [70-160 $\mu$m] band. The [24-70 $\mu$m] fraction decreases with increasing metallicity. The [160-1100 $\mu$m]submillimetre band can account for up to 25 per cent of the LTIR in metal-rich galaxies. We investigate the correlation between the total infrared (TIR) surface brightnesses/luminosities and monochromatic Spitzer and Herschel surface brightnesses/luminosities. The three Photodetector Array Camera and Spectrometer (PACS) bands can be used as reliable monochromatic estimators of the LTIR, the 100 $\mu$m band being the most reliable monochromatic tracer. There is also a strong correlation between the SPIRE 250 $\mu$m and LTIR, although with more scatter than for the PACS relations. We also study the ability of our monochromatic relations to reproduce integrated LTIR of nearby galaxies as well as LTIR of z ∼ 1-3 sources. Finally, we provide calibration coefficients that can be used to derive TIR surface brightnesses/luminosities from a combination of Spitzer and Herschel surface brightnesses/fluxes and analyse the associated uncertainties. {\textcopyright} 2013 The Authors.

abstract = {In this paper we present a new, essentially empirical, model for the relation between the mass of a dark matter halo/subhalo and the luminosity of a galaxy hosted in it. To estimate this, we replace the assumption of linearity between light and mass fluctuations with the assumption of monotonicity between galaxy light and halo or subhalo mass. We are enabled to proceed with this less restrictive ansatz by the availability of new, very high-resolution dark matter simulations and more detailed and comprehensive global galactic luminosity functions. We find that the relation between halo/subhalo mass and hosted galaxy luminosity is fairly well fitted by a double power law. The relation between halo mass and group luminosity has a shallower slope for an intermediate-mass region and is fairly well fitted by a two-branch function, with both branches double power laws. Both relations asymptote to L $\alpha$ M 4 at low M, while at high mass the former follows L $\alpha$ M 0.28 and the latter L $\alpha$ M 0.9. In addition to the mass-luminosity relation, we also derive results for the occupation number, luminosity function of cluster galaxies, group luminosity function and multiplicity function. Then, using a prescription for the mass function of haloes in under/overdense regions and some further assumptions on the form of the mass density distribution function, we further derive results for biasing between mass and light and mass and galaxy number, the light distribution function and the void probability distribution. Our results for the most part seem to match well with observations and previous expectations. We feel this is a potentially powerful way of modelling the relation between halo mass and galaxy luminosity, because the main inputs are readily testable against dark matter simulation results and galaxy surveys, and the outputs are free from the uncertainties of physically modelling galaxy formation.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {The appearance of active galactic nuclei (AGN) depends so strongly on orientation that our current classification schemes are dominated by random pointing directions instead of more interesting physical properties. Light from the centers of many AGN is obscured by optically thick circumnuclear matter and in radio-loud AGN, bipolar jets emanating from the nucleus emit light that is relativistically beamed along the jet axes. Understanding the origin and magnitude of radiation anisotropies in AGN allows us to unify different classes of AGN; that is, to identify each single, underlying AGN type that gives rise to different classes through different orientations. This review describes the unification of radio-loud AGN, which include radio galaxies, quasars, and blazars. We describe the classification and properties of AGN and summarize the evidence for anisotropic emission. We outline the two most plausible unified schemes for radio-loud AGN, one linking quasars and luminous radio galaxies and another linking BL{\~{}}Lac objects and less luminous radio galaxies. Using the formalism appropriate to samples biased by relativistic beaming, we show the population statistics for two schemes are in accordance with available data. We analyze the possible connections between low- and high-luminosity radio-loud AGN. We review potential difficulties with unification and conclude that none currently constitutes a serious problem. We discuss likely complications to unified schemes that are suggested by realistic physical considerations; these will be important to consider when more comprehensive data for larger complete samples become available. We conclude with a list of the ten questions we believe are the most pressing in this field.},

abstract = {We compare the central mass concentration of cold dark matter (CDM) halos found in cosmological N-body simulations with constraints derived from the Milky Way disk dynamics and from the Tully-Fisher relation. For currently favored values of the cosmological parameters ($\Omega$0{\~{}}0.3 $\Lambda$0=1-$\Omega$0{\~{}}0.7 h{\~{}}0.7 COBE- and cluster abundance-normalized $\sigma$8 big bang nucleosynthesis $\Omega$b), we find that halos with circular velocities comparable to the rotation speed of the Galaxy have typically 3 times more dark matter inside the solar circle than inferred from observations of Galactic dynamics. Such high central concentrations of dark matter on the scale of galaxy disks also imply that stellar mass-to-light ratios much lower than expected from population synthesis models must be assumed in order to reproduce the zero point of the Tully-Fisher relation. Indeed, even under the extreme assumption that all baryons in a dark halo are turned into stars, disks with conventional I-band stellar mass-to-light ratios [M/LI{\~{}}2+/-1(M/LI)solar] are about 2 mag fainter than observed at a given rotation speed. We examine several modifications to the $\Lambda$CDM model that may account for these discrepancies and conclude that agreement can only be accomplished at the expense of renouncing other major successes of the model. Reproducing the observed properties of disk galaxies thus appears to demand substantial revision to the currently most successful model of structure formation.},

We do so by taking advantage of the fact that the dust-to-metals ratio in the interstellar medium of galaxies appears to be constant. We argue that our value for Κd supersedes that of James et al. - who pioneered this approach for determining Κd - because we take advantage of superior data, and account for a number of significant systematic effects that they did not consider. We comprehensively incorporate all methodological and observational contributions to establish the uncertainty on our value, which represents a marked improvement on the oft-quoted 'order-of-magnitude' uncertainty on Κd. We find no evidence that the value of Κd differs significantly between galaxies, or that it correlates with any other measured or derived galaxy properties. We note, however, that the availability of data limits our sample to relatively massive (109.7 {\textless} M* {\textless} 1011.0M), high metallicity (8.61 {\textless} [12 + log10 O/H] {\textless} 8.86) galaxies; future work will allow us to investigate a wider range of systems.},

In this paper, we discuss the overall radio continuum morphology between 76 and 227 MHz and compare them with neutral hydrogen maps, 1.4 GHz continuum maps and optical images. Variation of diffuse emission is noticeable across the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) but absent across the bar of the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC). We also measure the integrated flux densities and derive the spectral indices for the MCs. A double power-law model with fixed $\alpha$1 = -0.1 fit between 19.7 MHz and 8.55 GHz yields $\alpha$0 = -0.66 ± 0.08 for the LMC. A power-law model yields $\alpha$8.55GHz85.5MHz = -0.82 ± 0.03 for the SMC. The radio spectral index maps reveal distinctive flat and steep spectral indices for the HII regions and supernova remnants, respectively. We find strong correlation between HII regions and Ha emission. Using a new 150 MHz-H$\alpha$ relation as a star formation rate indicator, we estimate global star formation rates of 0.068-0.161 M⊙ yr-1 and 0.021-0.050 M⊙ yr-1 for the LMC and SMC, respectively.

abstract = {The infrared (IR) emission plays a crucial role in understanding the star formation in galaxies hidden by dust. We first examined four estimators of the IR luminosity of galaxies, LFIR (Helou et al. 1988), LTIR (Dale et al. 2001a), revised version of LTIR (Dale {\&} Helou 2002) (we denote LTIR2), and LIR (Sanders {\&} Mirabel 1996) by using the observed SEDs of wellknown galaxies. We found that LIR provides excellent estimates of the total IR luminosity for a variety of galaxy SEDs. The performance of LTIR2 was also found to be very good. Using LIR, we then statistically analyzed the IRAS PSCz galaxy sample (Saunders et al. 2000) and found useful formulae relating the MIR monochromatic luminosities [L(12 $\mu$m) and L(25 $\mu$m)] and LIR. For this purpose we constructed a subsample of 1420 galaxies with all four IRAS band (12, 25, 60, and 100 $\mu$m) flux densities. We found linear relations between LIR and MIR luminosities, L(12 $\mu$m) and L(25 $\mu$m). The prediction error with a 95{\%} confidence level is a factor of 4-5. Hence, these formulae are useful for the estimation of the total IR luminosity only from 12 $\mu$m or 25 $\mu$m observations. We further tried to make an "interpolation" formula for galaxies at 0 {\textless} z {\textless} 1. For this purpose we construct the formula of the relation between 15-$\mu$m luminosity and the total IR luminosity. We conclude that the 15-$\mu$m formula can be used as an estimator of the total IR luminosity from 24 $\mu$m observation of galaxies at z ≃ 0.6. {\textcopyright} ESO 2005.},

abstract = {We construct the average radio spectral energy distribution (SED) of highly star-forming galaxies (HSFGs) up to z ∼ 4. Infrared and radio luminosities are bound by a tight correlation that is defined by the so-called q parameter. This infrared-radio correlation provides the basis for the use of radio luminosity as a star-formation tracer. Recent stacking and survival analysis studies find q to be decreasing with increasing redshift. It was pointed out that a possible cause of the redshift trend could be the computation of rest-frame radio luminosity via a single power-law assumption of the star-forming galaxies' (SFGs) SED. To test this, we constrained the shape of the radio SED of a sample of HSFGs. To achieve a broad rest-frame frequency range, we combined previously published Very Large Array observations of the COSMOS field at 1:4 GHz and 3 GHz with unpublished Giant Meterwave Radio Telescope (GMRT) observations at 325MHz and 610MHz by employing survival analysis to account for non-detections in the GMRT maps. We selected a sample of HSFGs in a broad redshift range (z ϵ [0:3; 4]; SFR ≥ 100 M yr -1 ) and constructed the average radio SED. By fitting a broken power-law, we find that the spectral index changes from $\alpha$1 = 0:42-0:06 below a rest-frame frequency of 4:3 GHz to $\alpha$2 = 0:94 ± 0:06 above 4:3 GHz. Our results are in line with previous low-redshift studies of HSFGs ( SFR {\textgreater} 10 M yr -1 ) that show the SED of HSFGs to differ from the SED found for normal SFGs ( SFR {\textless} 10 M yr -1 ). The difference is mainly in a steeper spectrum around 10 GHz, which could indicate a smaller fraction of thermal free-free emission. Finally, we also discuss the impact of applying this broken power-law SED in place of a simple power-law in K-corrections of HSFGs and a typical radio SED for normal SFGs drawn from the literature. We find that the shape of the radio SED is unlikely to be the root cause of the q-z trend in SFGs.},
