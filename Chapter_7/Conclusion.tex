In this study, we investigate 18 star-forming galaxies in the HRS catalog for their global relation of the low-frequency radio with IR luminosities.
We find a single power-law assumption for the frequency dependence of $\qn$ is valid across MWA frequencies and $1.5\GHz$, and their slope $\gamma$ is consistent with previous studies.
We also investigate the consistency of the radio SFR expected to be an extinction-free indicator.
Our sample shows that the spectral information for each galaxy is needed to estimate its SFR accurately because of a wide variety of $\qn$.
These results suggest that future observation with several radio bands is required at low frequencies for measuring accurate SFRs.

For further understanding of the low-frequency properties in star-forming galaxies, we need more samples from multi-band observation.
The updated GLEAM survey will reveal physical details with an order of magnitude better angular-resolution and sensitivity than the latest survey.
